Implementation of single layered neural network

This is the implementation of a perceptron, which  is a single-layer neural network that consists of input values, weights, bias, net sum followed by an activation function. It will accept the user defined inputs and based on that, it computes the the updated weights and the bias values. The process iterates based on the number of epochs and checks for the convergence of the neural network.
